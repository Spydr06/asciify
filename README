~ ASCIIFY ~

A set of simple tools for turning strings/files into individual ascii chars and vice versa.

This project is meant to teach me how to write GNU-coreutils like code in C using the GNU GPL license and the standard GNU toolset `gcc`, `autoconf`, `automake` and `make`.

Use this for educational purposes only.

* Building:
  
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
